## Packages
qrcode.react | Generating QR codes for offices
react-qr-scanner | Scanning QR codes (using this instead of react-qr-reader for better modern support)
date-fns | Formatting dates and times for attendance records

## Notes
The app relies on `navigator.geolocation` for both creating offices and scanning attendance.
QR codes generated by admin will contain the `officeId` as a string or number.
Employee scanning sends current GPS + scanned QR content to backend for validation.
